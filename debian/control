Description: Perl modules for the Skolab Groupware Server
 Skolab is the continuation of the Kolab 2 groupware. It is a secure,
 scalable, and reliable groupware server. It consists of a number of
 well-known and proven components for the standard tasks such as e-mail,
 directory service, and web service. Skolab adds intelligent interaction
 between the components, a web administration interface, management of
 free/busy lists, etc. Various clients can access Skolab, among them
 Kontact (KDE), Thunderbird (Mozilla) and Horde (web).
 .
 This package contains Perl modules that support the internal Skolab
 server functionality.  It is not intended for other purposes.
