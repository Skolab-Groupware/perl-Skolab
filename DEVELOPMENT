# Development notes

The perl-Skolab package is a standard perl package and a Skolab Server
core component. It is meant to be handled with the Makefile.PL
script. You will receive a standard "Makefile" by running "perl
Makefile.PL".

The Skolab Server packages were usually not released as source
packages. This should be changed with this new package layout. The
"dist" target will produce a perl-Skolab-*.tar.gz package that can be
distributed as source package.


## Version numbering

The package version will be set in

  lib/Skolab.pm

e.g.

  our $SKOLAB_BASE_VERSION = "2.4.0";
  my  $SKOLAB_GIT = 1;

### Release versions

Released packages should have the same core version as the server
release. As a part of Skolab Server 2.4.0 the version number should be
2.4.0. Pre-release candidates receive the suffix "~betaX" or "~rcX"
(e.g. 2.4.0~beta1).

Before tagging the next release the version number needs to be increased
to the new Skolab Server version (e.g. 2.4.0) and the Git switch needs to
be set to 0:

  our $SKOLAB_BASE_VERSION = "2.4.0";
  my  $SKOLAB_GIT = 0;

After updating $SKOLAB_BASE_VERSION and $SKOLAB_GIT you can commit these
changes and tag the release.

Now you can create the source tarball which will look like:

  perl-Skolab-2.4.0.tar.gz

Don't forget to change $SKOLAB_GIT back to 1 again and commit, so later
Git snapshots will be named correctly.

### Snapshots

Make sure lib/Skolab.pm contains the following line:

  my $SKOLAB_GIT = 1;

The release number will then receive the suffix "+git" and the current
date will be appended.

Source tarballs will then look like this:

  perl-Skolab-2.4.0+git20180810.tar.gz
